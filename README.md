# Mirror- Face Recognition Project by Nishtha Agarwal

Mirror is an attempt to control daily crimes by verifying the identity of people who enter our households. This project was built as a part of the Microsoft Engage Program 2022 where mentees had to build a project on one of the three given challenges while incorporating the agile methodology. I went for the Face Recognition Project and came up with the idea of Mirror web application that'll help <u>Prevent Crimes</u>.

<b>Motivation:</b> 

<b>Solved Problem:</b> This web application aims to offer a quick and easy way to recognise and verify the identity of employees who visit our places regularly to take readings of water, electricity, LPG meters; AC and RO servicing; etc. Many thefts happen day-to-day due to miscellaneous person entering our premises which can be prevented by double-checking the identity just by a click. 

<b>Learnings:</b> Through the Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2022 under the able guidance of my mentor - Shriladha Balasubramanian ma'am I was able to go from a person who just knew how to make static web pages to a person who can build and deploy a full stack web applications based on ML.
